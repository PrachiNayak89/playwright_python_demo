#### Task 2: Cross-Browser Automation for Support and Case Creation
Scenario

The application allows users to create both support tickets and cases. Recently, youâ€™ve been receiving reports of compatibility issues on different browsers. Your task is to create an automation script that performs the following steps on multiple browsers:

- Register and log in as a user.
- Create a support ticket.
- Create a case. 

#### Expected Output

#### An executable automation script that:
- Registers a new user.
- Logs in with the newly registered user.
- Creates both a support ticket and a case.
- Executes on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
